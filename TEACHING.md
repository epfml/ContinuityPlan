# Online Teaching Tips

All official teaching guidelines are provided [here](https://www.epfl.ch/education/educational-initiatives/online-lecturing/). This page summarizes the documentation in these pages that is relevant to our use case.

## Lectures
* **Tool:** The best tool available to us is [Zoom](https://epfl.zoom.us/). The Pro version of zoom is available to all Professors and Teaching Assistant. 
* **Setup:** First configure your account at <https://epfl.zoom.us/>
* Two choices:
    * **Meetings:** Recommended for courses with <200 students. A Skype-like meeting with many features (waiting rooms, polls, emoji reaction for quick replies, breakout rooms, ...).
    * **Webinars:** Recommended for courses with >200 students. Students cannot share video/audio.

### Configure your global settings
For the first time only, configure your global settings. These settings will then be set by default for future scheduled meetings.

* Go to <https://epfl.zoom.us/>
* Choose *"Sign in - Configure your account"*
* Choose *"Settings"* in the left menu bar and go the *"Meeting"* tab
* We advise you to keep the standard settings, except for:
    * **Host video**: *on*
    * **Participants video**: *on* 
    * **Audio type**: *Computer Audio*
    * **Mute participants upon entry**: *on*
    * **Auto saving chats**: *on*
    * **Co-host**: *on*
    * **Polling**: *on*
    * **Allow host to put attendee on hold**: *on*
    * **Nonverbal feedback**: *on* (Let participants quickly answer questions with reaction/emoji in the chat. It makes feedback much more convenient)
* Other interesting features might be:
    * **Attention tracking**: Lets you see an indicator if a participant does not have Zoom window in focus)
    * **Waiting room**: Participants join in a waiting room. You have to admit them to the meeting individually, this may be useful for exercise sessions.

### Schedule a meeting

* Go to <https://epfl.zoom.us/>
* Choose *"Host - Schedule a meeting"*
* In the form, enter the meeting details:
    * **Topic / Description**: Use a descriptive clear lecture title (optionally alongside a description)
    * **When / Duration / Time Zone**: Choose the time and duration of the lecture (these are not enforced. It is just a way for Zoom to allocate resources)
    * **Recurring meeting**: Do **not** tick the box
    * In **meeting options**, select:
        * **Disable** waiting room
        * **Enable** Record the meeting automatically, **in the cloud**

### Host a live lecture

* Get ready for the session:
    * Set up your tools, make sure you have:
        * A laptop or a desktop to run ZOOM, that has a camera and speaker
        * A suitable microphone
        * Wired internet (recommended by ZOOM)
    * If you use PowerPoint:
        * Start your PowerPoint presentation in present-mode
        * At the bottom left of your screen, you can swtich cursors (laser pointer, pen, hidden, ...)
* Start the meeting:
    * Go to <https://epfl.zoom.us/meeting>
    * Select your meeting and click **start**. This will prompt you to open your Zoom client, or download one.
    * You will be given the option of testing your microphone. 
    * Once you join the meeting, **your webcam image will be displayed**.
    * An cloud icon will show that **recordings** is underway. Recording can be paused/stopped. If stopped, it will generate a video file and start a new one when you restart recording.
    * In the menu bar:
        * The **share** function lets you share your slideshow. You can select which window to share
    * The **Polling** function lets you start a poll with multiple-choice questions for full-powered Q&A.
    * The **Chat** function lets you interact with the class through a text chat.
    * In **Participants, students can also react with **nonverbal feeback** using some emoji symbols for quick Q&A.
* Click **"End the meeting"** to stop recording at the end of the lecture.

### Pre-record a lecture

Just like for a live lecture, you can also pre-record a lecture and then share the link of the recorded video on Moodle (or any other platform of your choice).
