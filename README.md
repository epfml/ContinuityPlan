- Absences related to coronavirus – whether the result of a quarantine/self-isolation, working from home or a justified absence – must be entered into the [absence manager](https://absences.epfl.ch/) (Specific events > quarantine COVID-19).
- However, if you are sick – regardless of the cause – you must enter this as sick leave in the absence manager.
- Anyone who is sick is not required to provide a medical certificate until 19 April 2020.
