:warning: EPFL considers it an **absolute priority** that you be able to take care of your children and other loved ones. Professional priorities must therefore be reassessed, and you should talk to your head of service about the amount of work you can do remotely based on your personal situation. EPFL will be flexible.

## Principles
- Our top priorities are the health of staff members and anyone else involved in these activities, and our social responsibility to slow the spread of the virus. Efforts to minimize the damage that the health measures may cause to research projects are of secondary importance.
- The instructions provided on the [EPFL security service website](https://www.epfl.ch/campus/security-safety/en/health/coronavirus-covid19/), which were issued by EPFL, must imperatively be followed.
- Working remotely is the basic rule; any exceptions must be approved by your supervisor.
- Zoom meetings are encouraged.
- Any work that involves people being in contact physically must be put on hold until further notice.

## Campus
Card access to EPFL is suspended and all buildings are off limits. EPFL now requires all staff to work remotely until further notice. No one is allowed on site, apart from those who have been granted an exception by the DSPS.  If you need an exception, you must obtain formal permission through the webform: https://go.epfl.ch/covid19-tw-exception

### :grey_question: Absences [[source](https://www.epfl.ch/campus/security-safety/en/health/coronavirus-covid19/human-resources/)]
- Absences related to coronavirus – whether the result of a quarantine/self-isolation, working from home or a justified absence – must be entered into the [absence manager](https://absences.epfl.ch/) (Specific events > quarantine COVID-19).
- However, if you are sick – regardless of the cause – you must enter this as sick leave in the absence manager.
- Anyone who is sick is not required to provide a medical certificate until 19 April 2020.
